## Why ShipSec Studio?

- **Component-driven orchestration** – Drag-and-drop vetted discovery, DNS, HTTP, and enrichment components or wire in custom activities through the ShipSec SDK
- **Temporal reliability** – Every workflow run becomes a `shipsec-run-*` Temporal execution with retries, heartbeats, and resumability baked in
- **Live execution visibility** – Runs stream structured traces, Loki-backed logs, and per-node progress to the canvas in real time
- **Team-ready guardrails** – Secrets live behind Clerk-gated orgs, analytics respect privacy defaults, and every contract is enforced via shared Zod schemas
- **Single-machine friendly** – Docker Compose, PM2, and Bun keep the full stack runnable on a laptop while remaining production-faithful
