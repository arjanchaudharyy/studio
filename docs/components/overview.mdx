Components are the building blocks of ShipSec Studio workflows. Each component performs a specific task and can be connected together to create powerful automation pipelines.

## How Components Work

Each component has:

- **Inputs** – Data ports that accept connections from other components
- **Outputs** – Data ports that can be connected to downstream components  
- **Parameters** – Configurable settings in the sidebar

Components run inside Docker containers for isolation and reliability. Workflows are orchestrated by [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) with automatic retries and resumability.

## Component Structure

```typescript
interface ComponentDefinition<Input, Output> {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier
  label: string;        // Display name
  category: string;     // Category for grouping
  runner: RunnerConfig; // Execution configuration
  inputSchema: ZodSchema<Input>;
  outputSchema: ZodSchema<Output>;
  execute: (input: Input, context: ExecutionContext) => Promise<Output>;
}
```

## Example Pipelines

### Security Reconnaissance

```
Manual Trigger → Subfinder → DNSX → httpx → Webhook
```

1. **Manual Trigger** – User provides target domains
2. **Subfinder** – Discovers subdomains
3. **DNSX** – Resolves DNS records
4. **httpx** – Probes for live HTTP services
5. **Webhook** – Sends results to Slack/Teams

### Secret Detection

```
Manual Trigger → TruffleHog → OpenAI Chat → Webhook
```

1. **Manual Trigger** – User provides repository URL
2. **TruffleHog** – Scans for leaked credentials
3. **OpenAI Chat** – Analyzes and prioritizes findings
4. **Webhook** – Alerts security team

### User Offboarding

```
Manual Trigger → Okta Offboard → GitHub Remove → Google Unassign → Webhook
```

1. **Manual Trigger** – User email input
2. **Okta Offboard** – Deactivates Okta account
3. **GitHub Remove** – Removes org membership
4. **Google Unassign** – Reclaims license
5. **Webhook** – Notifies HR

## Execution Context

Components receive an `ExecutionContext` with access to:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `storage` | File upload/download to MinIO |
| `secrets` | Encrypted secrets access |
| `artifacts` | Workflow artifact storage |
| `trace` | Event recording |
| `logger` | Structured logging |
| `terminal` | Terminal output streaming |

## Building Custom Components

See the [Component Development Guide](/development/component-development) for detailed instructions on building your own components.
