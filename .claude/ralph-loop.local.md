add eslint rules commit by commit, loose to strict.

IMPORTANT: When adding ESLint rules, DO NOT disable them to make the linter pass. Instead, you MUST fix all code issues that the rules flag. Only add rules in a commit if you're willing to fix all violations immediately. Each commit should both enable rules AND fix all the resulting issues.
